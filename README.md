This is an improved version of the prompt used for [IFS Chat](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-HDXRaiOI3-ifs-chat). OpenAI no longer is allowing me to update this custom GPT for fears that it is offering medical advice. So any updates going forward would require building something outside of the OpenAI platform. I have decided to focus my efforts on helping people 1-1 as an IFS therapist and coach, so I'm sharing the improved prompt here. (I still think a chatbot like this can help make healing more accessible, but my interests and talents are more inline with helping people 1-1). 

If you'd like to use the new prompt, you can create your own custom GPT on OpenAI. Here are some instructions for [how to create your own custom GPT](https://zapier.com/blog/custom-chatgpt/). You're also welcome to create something outside of the OpenAI platform. 

You should be able to add information about your parts directly into the prompt. I haven't experimented with this yet, but let me know if you try it and it works!
